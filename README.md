Introduction
1. In this project music clips are classified into two different genres (Fast and Slow). Playlist of 60 songs(30 of each genre) has been created and 3 clips of 30 sec at different time locations from each song has been taken. Features namely MFCC's, zero crossing rate, spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, spectral roll-off, spectral contrast are extracted from these clips.
2. Dataset of these extracted features is used to train a machine learning classifier named K-nearest neighbour. Different configurations of features are used for classification to know the features which are best suited for our classification task.
3. Incorrectly classified music clips are also analyzed.
